 **# BigMart Sales Prediction**

**A Machine Learning Project to Predict Product Sales at Retail Outlets**

**## Problem Statement**

BigMart, a retail chain, wants to optimize its inventory and pricing strategies to maximize sales and profits. To achieve this, they need accurate sales predictions for each product at each of their outlets. This project aims to build a reliable machine learning model that can effectively predict product sales based on various product and outlet attributes.

**## Data Description**

The dataset provided for this project contains the following features:

* **Item_Identifier:** Unique product ID
* **Item_Weight:** Weight of the product
* **Item_Fat_Content:** Whether the product is low fat or not
* **Item_Visibility:** Percentage of total display area allocated to the product
* **Item_Type:** Category of the product
* **Item_MRP:** Maximum Retail Price of the product
* **Outlet_Identifier:** Unique store ID
* **Outlet_Establishment_Year:** Year in which the store was established
* **Outlet_Size:** Size of the store in terms of ground area covered
* **Outlet_Location_Type:** Type of city in which the store is located
* **Outlet_Type:** Type of outlet (grocery store or supermarket)
* **Item_Outlet_Sales:** Target variable, representing the sales of the product at a particular outlet

**## Project Structure**

The project is organized as follows:

* **data:** Contains the raw dataset and any processed data files
* **notebooks:** Contains Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and modeling
* **models:** Contains saved machine learning models
* **reports:** Contains any generated reports or visualizations
* **src:** Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training

**## Key Steps**

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Selection and Training**
5. **Model Evaluation**
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
7.
