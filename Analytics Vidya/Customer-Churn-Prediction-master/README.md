## Customer Churn Prediction for Savings Accounts

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for a bank to predict customer churn (falling below minimum balance in the next quarter) in their savings accounts. This will enable the bank to proactively engage with at-risk customers and implement retention strategies.

### Problem Statement

The bank lacks insight into which customers are likely to churn their savings accounts, leaving them exposed to lost revenue and customer relationships. This project intends to bridge this gap by building a robust model that accurately identifies potential churners based on relevant customer data.

### Data Description

The provided dataset comprises diverse attributes across three categories:

* **Demographic:** Age, gender, dependents, occupation, city (anonymized).
* **Customer-Bank Relationship:** Net worth category, branch code, days since last transaction.
* **Transactional:** Current and previous balances, monthly balances (average and total), credit and debit amounts.
* **Target:** Churn indicator (1: churn, 0: no churn) for the next quarter.

### Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Analyze data patterns, handle missing values, and address potential inconsistencies.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features from existing data to potentially improve model performance.
3. **Model Selection and Training:** Evaluate and train various machine learning algorithms for churn prediction.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to choose the best performer.
5. **Interpretability and Insights:** Identify key features influencing churn and provide insights for targeted retention strategies.

### Expected Outcomes

* **Accurate churn prediction:** The model should effectively identify customers at high risk of falling below the minimum balance in the next quarter.
* **Enhanced customer retention:** The bank can prioritize interventions and retention efforts towards potential churners.
* **Improved customer understanding:** Insights gained from the model can inform product and service adjustments to better cater to customer needs and prevent churn.
