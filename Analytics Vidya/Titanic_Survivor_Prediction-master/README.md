# Titanic_Survivor_Prediction

<h2>Problem statement:</h2>
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15,1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered
"unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately,
there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death
of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some
groups of people were more likely to survive than others. The task is to build
a predictive model to understand who is more likely to survive.
