## Titanic Survivor Prediction: Predicting Survival on the Titanic Ship

This repository houses the code and analysis for a Machine Learning project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. Explore the tragic incident through the lens of data science and build a model that sheds light on factors influencing survival rates.

**Problem Statement:**

On April 15, 1912, the maiden voyage of the supposedly "unsinkable" Titanic ended in tragedy after striking an iceberg. Out of 2224 passengers and crew onboard, 1502 perished, leaving a lasting mark on maritime history. While chance played a role, certain demographics demonstrably had higher survival rates. This project aims to uncover these patterns by building a predictive model for passenger survival.

**Data Description:**

The dataset utilized in this project includes information on each passenger, including:

* **Pclass:** Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
* **sex:** Gender (male, female)
* **Age:** Age in years
* **sibsp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard
* **parch:** Number of parents/children aboard
* **Ticket:** Ticket number
* **fare:** Passenger fare
* **cabin:** Cabin number
* **embarked:** Port of embarkation (Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton)
* **survival:** Survival status (0: No, 1: Yes)

**Project Highlights:**

* **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Analyze passenger demographics, identify missing values, and prepare the data for model training.
* **Feature Engineering:** Craft new features to enrich the dataset and potentially improve model performance.
* **Model Selection and Training:** Compare various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify the best fit for predicting survival.
* **Model Evaluation and Analysis:** Assess the chosen model's accuracy, understand its strengths and weaknesses, and interpret the importance of different features in influencing survival.
* **Visualization and Insights:** Present data insights and model performance through interactive visualizations and clear explanations.

**Repository Contents:**

* **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks containing data exploration, model training, and evaluation code.
* **data:** Folder containing the Titanic passenger dataset.
* **models:** Folder containing trained machine learning models.
* **readme.md:** This file (presenting the project overview).
